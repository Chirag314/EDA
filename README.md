Pandas Basics Readme
This document describes the basic functionalities of Pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis.

1. Data Structure:

Pandas works with two primary data structures:

Series: One-dimensional labeled array.
DataFrame: Two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns and rows.
2. Data Loading and Manipulation:

Importing data:
CSV: pd.read_csv("filename.csv")
Excel: pd.read_excel("filename.xlsx")
JSON: pd.read_json("filename.json")
Data selection and manipulation:
Basic indexing and slicing.
.loc and .iloc for advanced indexing.
Filtering data using boolean masks.
Data manipulation functions like fillna, dropna, and drop.
Data manipulation with conditional statements:
Using if statements and boolean operators.
Applying functions to subsets of data with .apply.
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Missing values:
Detecting missing values with isnull and isna.
Imputing missing values with fillna and other methods.
Data type conversion:
Converting data types with astype.
Handling categorical data with factorize and get_dummies.
4. Data Aggregation and Statistics:

Descriptive statistics:
describe method for basic statistics.
mean, median, std, etc.
Aggregation functions:
sum, mean, min, max, etc.
groupby for group-level statistics.
Pivot tables for summarizing and analyzing data.
5. Data Visualization:

Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating various plots and charts.
.plot method for basic visualizations.
hist, bar, scatter, etc. for specific types of plots.
6. Other Useful Functions:

Merging and joining DataFrames:
pd.merge for combining data from different sources.
Time series analysis:
to_datetime for converting dates to timestamps.
Time series-specific functions like resample and rolling.
